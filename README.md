## A little about the system
* The system is built with [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and follows [Test Driven Development](https://rubikscode.net/2021/05/24/test-driven-development-tdd-with-python/).
* It heavily uses design patterns like [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection), [Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern) and [Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern).
* We aim for 100% [code coverage](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/code-coverage).
* Mocks are the preffered way of [mocking](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/automated-testing/unit-testing/mocking/) dependencies in unit tests as we want to test our components in a controlled environment.

## Tests
Run all the quality checks, unit tests and integration tests:
```bash
make
```

Run only unit tests:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/unit --verbose
```

Run only integration tests:
```bash

## What is this?
This is a gift card management system, made to manage your gift cards in a hassle-free way. Say goodbye to those pesky spreadsheets!

## Why is this needed?
I was having a really hard time managing my gift card collection in a spreadsheet, I always needed to fill in all the information by hand like the date of purchase, denomination, source etc. and honestly it never felt intuitive to me and was becoming a lot of work that was hard to maintain.

## What does it solve?
It aims to provide an intuitive way of adding a gift card to your asset collection & retrieve them as and when needed.

## Who is this intended for?
GCManager can be used by anyone who believe that managing their gift cards is becoming a **PITA**, and they wouldn't want to waste their time anymore.

## Caveats
* This application was made keeping **AMAZON** brand in mind, but can be used for other brands that use **PIN** & **Redeem Code**.
