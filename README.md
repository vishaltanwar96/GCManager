## What is this?
This is a gift card management system, made to manage your gift cards in an hassle free way. Say goodbye to those pesky spreadsheets!

## Why is this needed?
I was having a really hard time managing my gift card collection in a spreadsheet, i always needed to fill in all the information by hand like the date of purchase, denomination, source etc and honestly it never felt intuitive to me and was becoming a lot of work that was hard to maintain.

It aims to provide an intuitive way of adding a gift card to your asset collection & retrieve them as and when needed.

## Who is this intended for?
GCManager can be used by anyone who believe that managing their gift cards is becoming a **PITA** and they wouldn't want to waste their time anymore.

## Caveats
* This application was made keeping **AMAZON** brand in mind, but can be used for other brands that use **PIN** & **Redeem Code**.
